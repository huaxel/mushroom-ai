# Mushroom Classification Project for Course AI Essentials 2025

## Introduction

This project aims to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible based on their physical characteristics. The project involves exploratory data analysis, model pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. A simple API and frontend are also deployed to demonstrate the model's capabilities.

## Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset and identify relevant features
* **Model Pipelines**: Train and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance
* **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models
* **API Development**: Build a simple API using FastAPI
* **API Deployment**: Deploy the API using Uvicorn and Cloudflare Workers & Pages
* **Simple Frontend**: Demonstrate the model's capabilities

## Technologies Used

* **Jupyter Notebooks**: Data analysis and model development
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization
* **scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost**: Machine learning tasks
* **FastAPI**: API development
* **Uvicorn**: API deployment
* **Cloudflare Workers & Pages**: Hosting the API and frontend
